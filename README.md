# helloWorld

My first repository for plugin development practicing.

I'm bad at this documentation of projects and stuff...tips and suggestions are greatly appreciated! Mostly I'm doing this to keep note of my ideas for now.

For this project, I'm aiming on making a Minecraft plugin for Spigot (1.8.8 R0.1 BuildTools: 45). To start out, I'm going to simply have a command /hello that will print "Hello Minecraft World!" in the chat. I'll improve it to have parameters so the player can say hello to the different environments, blocks, or mobs in the world.
